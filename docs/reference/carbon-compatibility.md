# Carbon audio compatibility

Status: Evolving  
Scope: `@carbonenginejs/runtime-audio/trinity`  
Audience: Runtime authors, content integrators, and maintainers  
Summary: Defines the maintained Carbon audio surface, adaptations, and intentionally unsupported native behavior.

## Contract

The `./trinity` entry owns the portable JavaScript form of Carbon audio schema
families `audio`, `trinityAudio`, and `trinityAudioApi`. Classes retain Carbon
field names, schema families, persistence metadata, and method provenance.

Portable behavior is implemented where it can be expressed without Wwise,
Python, an operating-system device manager, or a renderer. Browser realization
is supplied by the root package.

## Implemented behavior

The maintained graph includes:

- audio manager lifecycle, bank status, deferred events, global RTPC and state;
- per-object events, prefixes, RTPC values, switches, placement, culling, mute,
  and wake behavior;
- listener and emitter placement;
- event metadata and sound prioritization;
- event curves and RTPC-driven curve-set time;
- UI and music emitters;
- three-emitter stretch audio; and
- audio geometry data.

The exact class inventory is in the
[class-purpose catalog](classes/README.md).

## Adaptations

Some public values exist to preserve a useful serialized graph contract even
when Carbon supplies them through native setup rather than Blue persistence.
The principal example is emitter position and authored rotation.

| Runtime value | Graph field | Contract |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Name | `name` | Persisted game-object name. |
| Event prefix | `eventPrefix` | Persisted prefix applied to ordinary event posts. |
| Attenuation scaling | `scalingFactor` | Persisted value set by `SetAttenuationScalingFactor()`. |
| Position | `position` | Persisted authored placement available to headless consumers. |
| Authored rotation | `rotation` | Persisted notifying quaternion composed over parent placement. |
| Effective direction | `front`, `top` | Read-only axes sent to graph and backend consumers. |

Browser callbacks run on the JavaScript event loop. UI completion callbacks are
tracked per playing ID so overlapping events complete independently.

## Unsupported native behavior

The package does not emulate:

- Wwise device enumeration or device-change callbacks;
- Wwise profiler capture;
- native spatial-audio geometry processing, occlusion, or diffraction;
- native audio-input plugins;
- operating-system device selection; or
- Wwise middleware rendering.

Unsupported Carbon methods remain visible with explicit implementation
metadata where their schema surface is maintained.

## Provenance

Faithful and adapted classes are derived from the public MIT-licensed
[CarbonEngine](https://github.com/carbonengine) audio and Trinity contracts.
CarbonEngineJS original classes are identified separately in the
[class-purpose catalog](classes/README.md).

CarbonEngineJS is an independent project and is not affiliated with CCP Games.
