# Use authored or custom music

Status: Experimental  
Scope: `@carbonenginejs/runtime-audio`  
Audience: Browser application authors and audio integrators  
Summary: Describes the two supported music-engine integration paths and their lifecycle.

## Purpose

Runtime-audio can schedule a tools-generated authored music graph or delegate
music playback to an application-owned engine. Both paths join the same master
destination and event-routing lifecycle.

## Authored graph

Supply the library's `music` section and a loader that returns complete decoded
buffers for graph source IDs:

```js
import {
    CjsAudioSystem
} from "@carbonenginejs/runtime-audio";

const audio = new CjsAudioSystem({
    createContext: () => new AudioContext(),
    musicGraph,
    loadMedia: async (sourceID, track) =>
        loadDecodedMusicBuffer(sourceID, track)
});
```

The built-in `CjsMusicEngine` supports authored event targets and stops,
sequence and weighted-random playlists, switch and state decisions, segment
cue scheduling, transition boundaries, and fades.

The source graph may preserve data that the current scheduler does not play.
Stingers, transition segments, Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI)
tracks, Synth One tracks, and RTPC volume curves remain unsupported.

## Custom engine

For streaming, arbitrary user music, or another playback model, provide a
synchronous gesture-time factory:

```js
import {
    CjsAudioSystem
} from "@carbonenginejs/runtime-audio";

const audio = new CjsAudioSystem({
    createContext: () => new AudioContext(),
    createMusicEngine: ({ context, destination }) =>
        new ApplicationMusicEngine({ context, destination })
});

audio.Attach();
audio.Enable();

const playingID = audio.PostMusicEvent("play_example");
```

A custom engine implements `HandlesEvent`, `PostEvent`, `ExecuteAction`,
`Process`, and `Dispose`. Switch, state, volume, play-position, and seek methods
are optional capabilities. `PostEvent` calls its completion callback exactly
once.

`PostMusicEvent` intentionally bypasses the Carbon event catalog so
application-owned event names do not require synthetic Wwise metadata.

## Cache and cleanup

The built-in engine caches decoded buffers by source ID. Use
`ReleaseMusicMedia(sourceID)` or `ClearMusicMedia()` to release inactive
entries. `SetGraph()` and `Dispose()` cancel stale scheduling and clear
graph-owned cache state.

Active `AudioBufferSourceNode` objects retain their buffers until playback
finishes. Cache release changes future reuse, not an already playing source.
